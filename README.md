# FTC Pocket Schedule generation tool

## Usage
This utility is intended for use by teams and tournament organizers. In either case you need access to a printer
at the tournament, and should expect to print about one page per team attending.

The live web interface is available at [](http://6987hattrix.github.io/FTC-pocket-schedules),
or (if you do not expect to have internet access) the entire system can be [downloaded](https://github.com/6987HatTrix/FTC-pocket-schedules/archive/gh-pages.zip) and unzipped to your computer.

## Stuff to do

[x] Write better instructions
[ ] Beautify the instructions document
[ ] Allow a graphical way to choose how many copies to print and whether to collate them
[ ] Automatically generate a test set of rounds so people can test their team lists before the tournament
[ ] Add a manifest so the site can operate offline at a tournament
